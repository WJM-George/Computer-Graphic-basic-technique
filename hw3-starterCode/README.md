# CSCI 420 Assignment 3
## Name: Wu Kam Man. USC ID: kammanwu@usc.edu
## Basic Description
This project implements a basic ray tracer to render scenes using geometric primitives such as spheres and triangles.

## Features
- **Ray-Sphere Intersection**: Calculation of intersections of rays with spheres, allowing curved surfaces.
- **Ray-Triangle Intersection**: Rendering of using triangle for more complex geometric structures.
- **Phong Lighting**: Realistic lighting with ambient, diffuse, and specular components.
- **Shadow**: Basic shadow computation for objects under light sources.
- **To see the original result**: Check no_extra_credit jpegs.

## Extra Credit
- support: SuperSampling Antialiasing
- support: Soft shadow of scenes, check the images included. 
- support: Allowing recursive reflection, with 5 times of reflection.(Check all the 00x related jpeg please)
